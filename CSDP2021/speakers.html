			      <strong>Abstract: </strong>
				 The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new computing paradigm spanning smart home, wearable devices, smart cities, and intelligent transportation systems. Building security into IoT is critical today. However, many unique features in IoT, including device resource constraints, device/vendor diversity, and cross-device physical interactions often make traditional IT security approaches impractical. To address those challenges, in this talk, I will present three of our recent research efforts. First, I will introduce a lightweight malware infection detector for IoT devices. Second, I will present Poseidon, a system that mitigates volumetric DDoS attacks with programmable switches. Third, I will briefly discuss IoTMon, an IoT device physical interaction control system, which can discover all potential inter-app interaction chains and analyze risk levels of those interaction chains. </p>

			      <strong>Abstract: </strong>
				  Containerized microservices have been widely deployed in industry. Meanwhile, security issues also arise. Many security enhancement mechanisms for containerized microservices require predefined rules and policies. However, it is challenging when it comes to thousands of microservices and a massive amount of real-time unstructured data. Hence, automatic policy generation becomes indispensable. In this paper, we focus on the automatic solution for the security problem: irregular traffic detection for RPCs. We propose Informer, which is a two-phase machine learning framework to track the traffic of each RPC and report anomalous points automatically.  In evaluations, we applied Informer to a dataset containing more than 7 billion lines of raw RPC logs sampled from an large Kubernetes system for two weeks. </td>

			      <strong>Abstract: </strong>
				  Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) enables user-level code to create private memory regions called enclaves, whose code and data are protected by the CPU from software and hardware attacks outside the enclaves. Recent work introduces
library operating systems (LibOSes) to SGX so that legacy applications can run
inside enclaves with few or even no mod- ifications. As virtually any
non-trivial application demands multiple processes, it is essential for LibOSes
to support mul- titasking. However, none of the existing SGX LibOSes support
multitasking both securely and efficiently.  This topic presents Occlum, a system that
enables secure and efficient multitasking on SGX. We implement the LibOS
processes as SFI-Isolated Processes (SIPs). SFI is a software
instrumentation technique for sandboxing untrusted modules (called domains). We
design a novel SFI scheme named MPX- based, Multi-Domain SFI (MMDSFI) and
leverage MMDSFI to enforce the isolation of SIPs. We also design an indepen-
dent verifier to ensure the security guarantees of MMDSFI. With SIPs safely
sharing the single address space of an en- clave, the LibOS can implement
multitasking efficiently. The Occlum LibOS outperforms the state-of-the-art SGX
LibOS on multitasking-heavy workloads by up to 6, 600× on micro-
benchmarks and up to 500× on application
benchmarks.

			      <strong>Abstract: </strong>
				  Internet  of Things  platforms  prosper  home  automation applications (apps). Prior research concerns intra-appsecurity. Our work reveals that automation apps, even secured individually, still cause a family of threats when they interplay, termed as Cross-App Interference (CAI) threats. We systematically categorize such threats and encode them using satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). We present HOMEGUARD, a system for  detecting  and  handling  CAI  threats  in  real  deployments. A  symbolic  executor  is  built  to  extract  rule  semantics,  and instrumentation is utilized to capture configuration during app installation. Rules and configuration are checked against SMT models,  the solutions  of  which indicate  the  existence  of corre-sponding CAI threats. We further combine app functionalities, device  attributes  and  CAI  types  to  label  the  risk  level  of  CAI instances. In our evaluation, HOMEGUARD discovers 663 CAI instances from 146 SmartThings market apps, imposing minor latency  upon  app  installation  and  no  runtime  overhead.

			      <strong>Abstract: </strong>
				  The Internet of Things enables interaction between IoT devices and users through the cloud. The cloud provides services such as account monitoring, device management, and device control. As the center of the IoT platform, the cloud provides services to IoT devices and IoT applications through API. Therefore, the permission verification of the API is essential. However, we found that some APIs are unverified, which allows unauthorized users to access cloud resources or control devices that threaten the security of devices and cloud. To check for unauthorized access to the API, we developed a tool to check the permission verification of the cloud API. Through observation, we found there is a large amount of interactive information between IoT Application and cloud, which include the APIs and related parameters, so we can extract them by analyzing the logic of the IoT Application, and use this for mutating API test cases. Through these test cases, we can effectively check the permissions of the API. In our research, we extracted a total of 5 platform APIs. Among them, the proportion of APIs without permission verification reached 13.3%. Our research shows that attackers can use APIs without permission verification to obtain smart home devices' privacy or control of devices.</p>

				  An Empirical Study on ARM Disassembly Tools

			      <strong>Abstract: </strong>
				  With the increasing popularity of embedded devices, ARM is becoming the popular architecture for them. In the meanwhile, there is a pressing need to perform security assessments for these devices. Due to different types of peripherals, it is challenging to dynamically run the firmware of these devices in an emulated environment. Therefore, the static analysis is still commonly used. Existing work usually leverages off-the-shelf tools to disassemble stripped ARM binaries and (implicitly) assume that reliable disassembling binaries and function recognition are solved problems. However, whether this assumption really holds is unknown. 
</p>
We conduct the first comprehensive study on ARM disassembly tools. Specifically, we build 1, 896 ARM binaries (including 248 obfuscated ones) with different compilers, compiling options, and obfuscation methods. We then evaluate them using eight state-of-the-art ARM disassembly tools (including both commercial and noncommercial ones) on their capabilities to locate instructions and function boundaries. These two are fundamental ones, which are leveraged to build other primitives. Our work reveals some observations that have not been systematically summarized and/or confirmed. For instance, we find that the existence of both ARM and Thumb instruction sets, and the reuse of the BL instruction for both function calls and branches bring serious challenges to disassembly tools. Our evaluation sheds light on the limitations of state-of-the-art disassembly tools and points out potential directions for improvement. To engage the community, we release the data set, and the related scripts at https://github.com/valour01/arm_disasssembler_study
